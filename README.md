# WebStudio

## Description

WebStudio is a single-page website for a web studio that showcases its services,
portfolio, order form, and subscription options. The website employs semantic
markup and is designed to be responsive across all device types, with a
mobile-first approach.

## Features

The website consists of the following sections:

- **Navigation Menu**: Easy access to different sections of the site.
- **Hero Section**: A prominent section with a call-to-action button that
  triggers a modal window containing the order form.
